[Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) pools users into ten leagues (from Bronze, Silver, ..., Diamond). Each week, the top XP-scoring members of each league are promoted and the bottom scoring-XP members are demoted (the specifics are [here](https://duolingo.fandom.com/wiki/League)). Assuming no users enter, this can be modeled as a discrete time Markov chain:

$$\mathbf{x}_{n+1} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_n$$

where $\mathbf{x}_i$ is the vector of population levels for each league in week
$i$ and $\mathbf{A}$ is a tridiagonal, irreducible, [left-stochastic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_matrix) matrix representing the transitions. Starting from a distribution where everyone is in the bottom three leagues, and assuming no one enters or leaves, we observe the existing transition rules push populations towards the higher leagues:

We can calculate this steady state distribution using linear algebra. In particular, we identify the principal eigenvector of $\mathbf{A}$, which will be associated with an eigenvalue of 1.

A question I have: Can one construct a triadiagonal, irreducible left-stochastic matrix $\mathbf{A}$, given a specified principal eigenvector? This would be of use to Duolingo, if say, they wanted most users to be _near_ the top (i.e., in the pearl and obsidian leagues).

One idea is to cast this as a constraint satisfaction problem. In particular, we can create the following formulation, where the decision variables, $a_{ij}$, are the entries of the matrix $\mathbf{A}$, $\mathbf{v}$ is the (given) dominant eigenvector, and $\epsilon > 0$ is a given minimum transition proportion:

$$
\begin{align}
&\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}v_j = v_i \quad \forall i \in \{1,\dots,n\} \\
&\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ij} = 1 \quad \forall j \in \{1,\dots,n\} \\
&a_{ij} =  0 \quad \forall i,j \in \{1,\dots,n\}, |i-j| > 1 \\
&a_{ij} \ge \epsilon \quad \forall i,j \in \{1, \dots, n\}, |i-j| \le 1 \\
&0 \le a_{ij} \le 1 \quad \forall i,j \in \{1, \dots, n\}
\end{align}
$$

Here, constraints (1) assert that $\mathbf{v}$ is an eigenvector of $\mathbf{A}$, with eigenvalue 1. Constraints (2) and (5) ensure that $\mathbf{A}$ is left-stochastic (by enforcing column sums to equal 1, and entries to be between 0 and 1). Constraints (3) limit our search to tridiagonal matrices. Constraints (4) enforce the matrix to be irreducible, by guaranteeing all elements on the tridiagonal are at least $\epsilon > 0$.

Constraints (4) are a little bit of a hack. You don't need all elements on the tridiagonal to be strictly positive in order to guarantee irreducibility, and so we are cutting off feasible solutions. However, I haven't yet found a way to express the irreducibility with a linear constraint.

However, with $\epsilon$ set to 0.01, for a given $\mathbf{v}$, CPLEX was able to find a solution. I set a target distribution 5% for the bottom five leagues, 10% for the emerald and amythest, 20% for pearl, 30% for obsidian, and 5% for diamond, and got the following transition probabilities. The resulting transition matrix then leads a random distribution towards the target. The convergence, however, is rather slow (it takes 3500 weeks to get there):
